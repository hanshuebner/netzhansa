I am a programmer and electronics tinkerer.  My hobby is also my
profession.  In this blog, I mostly write about stuff that I do in my
free time.

You can find my open source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/hanshuebner).  I'm also on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hanshuebner).  If you want to reach me
